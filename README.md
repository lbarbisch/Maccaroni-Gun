# Macaroni-Gun
A fully 3D printed toy gun that shoots pasta.  
  
The idea for this came up when I stumbled upon this meme:

A friend an I took upon the challenge to construct a device that can "shoot" macaroni pasta.  

## V0

This is the first version of a macaroni shooting device.
It is very bad and the major problem with this, that macaronis are brittle and this version works by hitting it with a hammer.  
So the macaroni shatters and the force isn't transferred well.

## V1 (work in progress)

This uses two flywheels made from TPU to softly grip the macaroni and accelerate it without shattering it.  
It and its internals are documented [here](https://barbisch.ch/projects/macaroni-gun/).
