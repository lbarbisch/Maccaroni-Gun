# Maccaroni-Gun
A fully 3D printed toy gun that shoots pasta.  
  
The idea for this came up when I stumbled upon this meme:

A friend an I took upon the challenge to construct a device that can "shoot" maccaroni pasta.  

## V0

This is the first version of a maccaroni shooting device.
It is very bad and the major problem with this, that maccaronis are brittle and this version works by hitting it with a hammer.  
So the maccaroni shatters and the force isn't transferred well.

## V1 (work in progress)
An idea for a second version is using flywheels, similar as in certain NERF guns.
If these wheels are slightly soft the maccaroni (hopefully) doesn't shatter.
Also the accelleration would be much higher than with a hammer.
